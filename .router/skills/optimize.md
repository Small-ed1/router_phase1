# Code Optimization Skill

When optimizing code, follow these steps:

1. Profile the code to identify bottlenecks
2. Look for algorithmic improvements first
3. Optimize memory usage
4. Use efficient data structures
5. Consider caching for repeated computations
6. Minimize I/O operations
7. Use lazy loading where appropriate

Always measure performance before and after changes.
